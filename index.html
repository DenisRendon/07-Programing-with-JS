1. Flow control has given me problems in the past,

2. control flow allows our program to make decisions about what code is executed and when.Controling the flow of code
3. conditional statements are checks to see if a certian condition is true or faluse. If the condition is true then run code A, it its false then run code b.
4. loops allow us to perform repetitive tasks with less code. using loops we can iterate over an arrat and perform some sort of action on each piece of data in the array, or we can use a liip to compule a list of all the items
5. conditionals -- if/else/else if statements, switch, ternary
6. loops -- for loop, do/while loop
